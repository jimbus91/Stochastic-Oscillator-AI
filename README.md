This is a script that uses the yfinance library to download historical data for a stock specified by the user's input for the stock's ticker symbol. It then calculates the Stochastic %K and %D lines for the last year of data, trains a HistGradientBoostingRegressor model on this data, and uses the model to make predictions for the next 30 days. The predictions are then plotted along with the historical data, with the addition of random noise to the predictions. The script also uses matplotlib and pandas libraries to perform data manipulation and visualization.
